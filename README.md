# LeetCodeChallenges

This repository contains Python solutions to various LeetCode problems as well as **algorithms practice modules**. Each solution and module is implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind, with a focus on learning and understanding algorithmic concepts.

**Note:** This repository is for **learning and practice purposes only**, not production use.

## Repository Structure

* **LeetCode problems**

  * Each problem is in a separate `.py` file
  * Solutions use **classes or functions** for easy testing and readability

* **Algorithms practice modules**

  * **Sorting algorithms**

    * Bubble Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Radix Sort
    * Hunting Sort (if implemented)

  * **Graph algorithms**

    * BFS (Breadth-First Search)

## Features

* Clean and self-contained implementations
* Step-by-step visualization for graph algorithms (BFS)
* Modular and reusable code for learning

## Usage

* Import the module or run individual `.py` files
* For BFS paths visualization, ensure you have **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib** installed:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```
